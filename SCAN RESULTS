Potential Security Risks from Open Ports:
- Port 22 (SSH): Vulnerable to brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used.
- Port 80 (HTTP): Unencrypted traffic vulnerable to interception and web attacks.
- Port 443 (HTTPS): Risk if SSL/TLS is outdated or misconfigured.
- Port 53 (DNS): Can be exploited for DNS amplification attacks.
- Port 139 (NetBIOS): Often targeted for SMB exploits and unauthorized access.
