Analyze Packet Capture with Wireshark
1. Start Wireshark and Select Your Network Interface

Open Wireshark.

Choose the network interface connected to your local network (e.g., eth0 or wlan0).

Click Start to begin capturing packets.

2. Run Your Nmap Scan

While Wireshark is capturing, run your Nmap TCP SYN scan:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24


This will generate network packets Wireshark can capture.

3. Stop Wireshark Capture

After the scan completes, click the Stop button in Wireshark.

4. Apply Display Filters

To focus on the scan-related traffic, use filters like:

tcp.flags.syn == 1
(shows SYN packets sent by Nmap)

ip.addr == <target_IP>
(to see packets to/from a specific IP)

5. Analyze Packets

Look for SYN packets sent to target ports.

Check responses:

SYN-ACK = open port

RST = closed port

See how Nmap performs the scan stealthily (only sending SYN without completing handshake).

6. Save the Capture (Optional)

Save the capture file for future review:
File → Save As → your_capture.pcap
