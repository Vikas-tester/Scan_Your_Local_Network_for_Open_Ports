Common Services on Open Ports

Port Number	       Service Name     	       Description	                                  Security Notes
22                 SSH                       Secure remote login and command execution.     Should be secured with strong auth; common target for brute-force attacks.
80                 HTTP                      Standard web traffic (unencrypted).            Vulnerable to MITM attacks if not using HTTPS.
443                HTTPS                     Encrypted web traffic using SSL/TLS.           More secure than HTTP; ensure valid certificates.
53                 DNS                       Resolves domain names to IP addresses.         Open DNS servers can be abused for DNS amplification attacks.
139                NetBIOS Session Service.  File and printer sharing on Windows networks.  Often targeted for SMB exploits; best to restrict or disable if unused.

Summary:

Ports like 22, 80, and 443 are common on servers providing web or remote access services.

Port 53 is critical for DNS but can be abused if open to the internet.

Port 139 relates to Windows file sharing and can be risky if exposed externally.
