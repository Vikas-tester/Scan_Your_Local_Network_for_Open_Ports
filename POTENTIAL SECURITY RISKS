Potential Security Risks from Open Ports


Port	      Service	     Risks
22          SSH          Brute-force attacks to guess passwords.

Exploitation of weak or outdated SSH versions.


If misconfigured, could allow unauthorized remote access. |
| 80 | HTTP | - Vulnerable to unsecured data transmission (no encryption).

Susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

Possible web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection). |
| 443 | HTTPS | - If SSL/TLS is outdated or misconfigured, susceptible to SSL attacks.

Misissued or expired certificates can cause trust issues. |
| 53 | DNS | - DNS amplification attacks if the server allows recursive queries from outside.

Can be used for DNS cache poisoning or spoofing. |
| 139 | NetBIOS/SMB | - Exploitation of SMB vulnerabilities (e.g., EternalBlue).

May allow unauthorized file sharing or data access.

Often targeted by malware and ransomware attacks. |



General Risks of Open Ports

Increased attack surface: Each open port is a potential entry point.

Exploitation of unpatched services: Vulnerabilities in services listening on these ports.

Unauthorized access if services arenâ€™t properly secured.

Data leakage or interception especially on unencrypted protocols.
