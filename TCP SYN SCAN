TCP SYN Scan with Nmap
Run this command in your terminal:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24


-sS means TCP SYN scan, also called a "stealth scan".

It sends SYN packets (like the first step in a TCP handshake) to each target port.

If a port replies with SYN-ACK, it's open.

If it replies with RST, it's closed.

This scan is faster and less likely to be detected by some firewalls because it doesnâ€™t complete the full TCP handshake.

The target 192.168.1.0/24 tells Nmap to scan all IP addresses in the subnet from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254.
